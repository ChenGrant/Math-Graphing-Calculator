# Math-Graphing-Calculator

Description: This project consists of a scientific calculator, statistics calculator, graphing and calculus calculator, and trigonometry visualizer. The scientific calculator includes all standard functions alongside additional features such as the prime factorization of a given number. The statistics calculator determines the central tendencies of the input dataset and stores it in a database. As well, this statistics mode determines the PDF and CDF of binomial distribution functions. The graphing calculator graphs functions and the user can control the area of view. The calculus calculator allows for users to find a functionâ€™s derivative at a given point or its integral along an interval. Additionally, this calculus mode finds the point of intersection between two functions using binary search. The trigonometry visualizer displays a triangle inside the unit circle along with its angle which acts as an argument for the trigonometric functions.
